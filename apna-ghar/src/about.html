        <h2>💬 Our Motto:</h2>
         <b><span style ="color:blueviolet"  > "Apna Ghar, Sabka Ghar" — because every student deserves a home away from home.</span></b>
    </p>

    <h1>📖 Our Story</h1>
    <p>Apna Ghar started with one idea in mind — to help students feel at home, even when they’re far from it. 
    We noticed that while many PGs offered basic living spaces, few cared about comfort, cleanliness, affordability, and emotional well-being.
    So, we created Apna Ghar – Sabka Ghar — a space where students can find PG by sitting at their home at affodabe Room rent . Overtime , we’ve welcomed students from across Ranchi and beyond, helping them settle in, study hard, and grow with confidence.</p>

    <h1>🎯 Our Mission</h1>
    To provide safe, comfortable, and affordable accommodation for students in Ranchi, with a focus on quality service,
     emotional support, and a homely environment.

    <h1>👁️‍🗨️ Our Vision</h1>
    To become Ranchi’s most trusted PG finder for students — where every room is more than just a place to stay; it's a place to belong.
